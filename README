	│       │   │   ├── Constants.java (saved all the variables in constants file, to avoid hard coding in main code files)	    
    └── pom.xml (added rest assured, testNg dependencies)
    
To run test cases:

To run the tests, execute the following command in your project directory: "mvn test"
One can also run specific test from IDE, by selecting and running specific test by TestNg    


Some of the Test Cases:
To verify the page history is updated when there is any changes made (latest timestamp for revision history for title)

To verify the html is loaded for offline page
